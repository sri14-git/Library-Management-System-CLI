# **Function Explanation File**

This section explains the purpose and functionality of key classes and methods in the Library Management System.

## **Package: org.lms**

### **ðŸ“œ Main.java**

#### **public static void main(String\[\] args)**

* **Purpose:** Entry point of the application.  
* **Functionality:**  
  * Initializes Scanner for user input.  
  * Sets up JPA EntityManagerFactory and EntityManager for the persistence unit "LibraryPU".  
  * Instantiates LibrarianController and MembersController.  
  * Enters a loop to display the main menu: Login as Librarian, Login as Member, or Exit.  
  * Based on user choice, it calls the respective controller's MainMenu method.  
  * Handles InputMismatchException for invalid menu choices.  
  * Closes Scanner, EntityManager, and EntityManagerFactory on exit.

## **Package: org.lms.controllers**

## **LibrarianController.java**

#### **public LibrarianController(Scanner sc, EntityManager em)**

* **Purpose:** Constructor.  
* **Functionality:** Initializes Scanner and service classes (AuthService, BookService, MemberService, TransactionService) with the provided EntityManager.

#### **public void MainMenu()**

* **Purpose:** Handles librarian login and displays the librarian's main operational menu.  
* **Functionality:**  
  * Prompts for admin username and password.  
  * Authenticates using authService.authenticate().  
  * If authentication is successful for "admin", it enters a loop displaying options: Manage Books, Manage Members, Manage Transactions, Exit.  
  * Calls respective manage...() methods or exits based on choice.  
  * Catches NoResultException, NullPointerException (for login issues), and InputMismatchException.

#### **public void manageBooks()**

* **Purpose:** Provides functionalities for book management.  
* **Functionality:** Loop with options:  
  * **Add Book:** Takes book details, creates a Book object with Status.AVAILABLE, and saves it using bookService.save().  
  * **Update Book stocks:** Lists books. Prompts for Book ID. Updates copiesAvailable and totalCopies. If status was UNAVAILABLE and copies become \>0, it can be set to AVAILABLE. Uses bookService.update().  
  * **Delete Book:** Lists available books. Prompts for Book ID. Checks for active transactions related to the book. If none (or if the check is bypassed by NoSuchElementException), sets the book's status to UNAVAILABLE and copies to 0 using bookService.update().  
  * **List Books:** Displays all books using bookService.findAll() and bookService.printBooks().  
  * **List Available Books:** Displays books with status \= AVAILABLE using bookService.getAvailableBooks().  
  * **Exit:** Exits this submenu.  
  * Handles InputMismatchException.

#### **public void manageMembers()**

* **Purpose:** Provides functionalities for member management.  
* **Functionality:** Loop with options:  
  * **Add Members:** Takes member details. Checks if username exists via memberService.findByUsername().  
    * If username exists and name matches, updates password, sets status to ACTIVE.  
    * If username exists and name differs, suggests changing username.  
    * Else, creates a new Member with Status.ACTIVE and saves using memberService.save().  
  * **Delete Members:** Lists active members. Prompts for Member ID. Checks for member's active transactions. If none, sets member's status to INACTIVE using memberService.update().  
  * **View All Members:** Displays all members using memberService.findAll() and memberService.printMembers().  
  * **View All Active Members:** Displays members with status \= ACTIVE.  
  * **Find By ID:** Prompts for ID, displays member using memberService.findById().  
  * **Find By Username:** Prompts for username, displays member using memberService.findByUsername().  
  * **Make User Active:** Lists inactive members. Prompts for ID. Sets status to ACTIVE using memberService.update().  
  * **Exit:** Exits this submenu.  
  * Handles InputMismatchException.

#### **public void manageTransactions()**

* **Purpose:** Provides functionalities for viewing transactions.  
* **Functionality:** Loop with options:  
  * **All Transactions:** Uses transactionService.findAllTransactions().  
  * **Transactions of A Member:** Prompts for Member ID, uses transactionService.getMemberTransactions().  
  * **Transactions of Type:** Prompts for TransactionType (BORROW/RETURN), uses transactionService.getTransactionsByType().  
  * **Transactions by Status:** Prompts for status and type, filters results from transactionService.getTransactionsByType().  
  * **Find By ID:** Prompts for Transaction ID, uses transactionService.findById().  
  * **Find By Book ID:** Prompts for Book ID, uses transactionService.getbyBookId().

#### **public void borrowBook(int memberId, int bookId)**

* **Purpose:** Handles the logic for a member borrowing a book.  
* **Functionality:**  
  * Fetches Book and Member. Validates their existence and status.  
  * Checks if book copies are available (should be copiesAvailable \> 0).  
  * Decrements book.copiesAvailable, increments book.timesBorrowed, and updates the book via bookDAO.update().  
  * Creates a new Transaction with type BORROW, Status.ACTIVE, current date, and an expectedReturnDate (7 days from borrow).  
  * Saves the transaction using transactionDAO.save().

#### **public void returnBook(int memberId, int transactionId)**

* **Purpose:** Handles the logic for a member returning a book.  
* **Functionality:**  
  * Fetches the original BORROW transaction using transactionDAO.findOpenBorrow() (validates it's active and belongs to the member).  
  * Fetches the Book and Member. Validates.  
  * Checks for late returns by comparing expectedReturnDate with the current date.  
  * Increments book.copiesAvailable.  
  * Creates a new Transaction with type RETURN, Status.COMPLETED, and actualReturnDate set to now. Saves this new transaction.  
  * Updates the original BORROW transaction: sets its status to COMPLETED and actualReturnDate to now. Updates via transactionDAO.update(). (Note: borrow.setQuantity(borrowedQty \- 1\) seems to imply multiple copies per transaction, but borrowBook sets quantity to 1\. If quantity is always 1, setting status to COMPLETED is sufficient).  
* public List\<Transaction\> getMemberTransactionByType(int memberId, TransactionType type, Status status): Calls transactionDAO.getMembersTransactionsByType().  
* public List\<Transaction\> getMemberTransactions(int memberId): Calls transactionDAO.findByMemberId().
